# Python 3 Computational Physics Lab

The aim of this collection of scripts implements basic statistical physics models in Python 3. Athough it is not aimed to 
computer science or software engineering students, the code implemented introduces the lab attendees to fundamental Python 3
concepts such as classes, inheritance, properties and decorators. Also, it shows how the popular numpy and matplotlib libraries can
be useful for scientific computing and visualisation.

## Folder 1: MCMC_Ising

In this demostration the Ising spin-glass models is simulated using the popular class of 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, in particular the Metropolis algorithm

* Ising_obj.py contains the definition of the Spin and the SpinGlass objects
* Ising2D.py is the main scripts that implements the simulation

## Folder 2: KMC_SAM

In this demonstration, the Surface Adsorbation Model (SAM) is implemented and simulated using Kinetic Monte Carlo
